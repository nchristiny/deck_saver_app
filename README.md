# DECK SAVER - Under construction
## Hearthstone®: Heroes of Warcraft™

## Deck Saver is a web app using the public [Hearthstone API](http://hearthstoneapi.com/ "Hearthstone API") to save various constructed decks for each class.

### Use Case: 

Imagine you have crafted the perfect deck for your favorite class. It has a 100% win rate. You are flying up the ladder to legendary. All of a sudden the meta changes, and there is a new "Neat and Exciting" deck that everyone is raving to try. You wish to give it a go, but it is a hassle to have to remember or write down your trusty old deck. As a user, I would like to use **Deck Saver** to save all my favorite decks for each class without having to memorize or write them down. Pretty sweet.

## Stretch use case: 

As a user I wish to be able to share a saved deck on social media, and make them public or private on my profile.

### Created by Nicholas Christiny. 

I have played Hearthstone since beta. I don't play video games much anymore, but I find that I still regularly play Hearthstone, especially since they expanded to mobile platforms. It has bothered me that there was no way to save your previous decks, which I feel would help people experiment more with different builds. 

This web app is my attempt to do away with the pencil and paper (or spreadsheet) list aspect of keeping track of your favorite constructed decks, and also a chance to simply play around with the public API of a game that I very much love and enjoy. Thanks go out to Blizzard devs for making the API available.
